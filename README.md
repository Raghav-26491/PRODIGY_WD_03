# Prodigy-InfoTech-Web-Dev-Task-3-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game developed as part of the Prodigy InfoTech Web Development Task 3. It allows players to enjoy the classic Tic Tac Toe game against a friend. The game features a simple and responsive design, clear game status display, and a reset button to start a new game.

To start playing Tic Tac Toe, players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in the grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game. If all cells are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.
